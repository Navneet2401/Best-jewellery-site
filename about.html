      <h2>Jewellery</h2>
      <p>Jewellery (or jewelry in American English) consists of decorative items worn for personal adornment, such as brooches, rings, necklaces, earrings, pendants, bracelets, and cufflinks. Jewellery may be attached to the body or the clothes. From a western perspective, the term is restricted to durable ornaments.</p>

          <h2>Forms and function of Jewellery </h2>
          <p>Humans have used jewellery for a number of different reasons:

            functional, generally to fix clothing or hair in place.
            as a marker of social status and personal status, as with a wedding ring
            as a signifier of some form of affiliation, whether ethnic, religious or social.
            Also,to provide talismanic protection (in the form of amulets)
            as an artistic display
            as a carrier or symbol of personal meanings such as love, mourning, a personal milestone or even luck
            generally considered as a good investment
            and superstition
            Most quantify cultures at some point have had a practice of keeping large amounts of wealth stored in the form of jewellery. Numerous cultures store wedding dowries in the form of jewellery or make jewellery as a means to store or display coins. Alternatively, jewellery has been used as a currency or trade good to buy and sell.[</p>

          <h2>Materials and methods</h2>
          <p>In creating jewellery, gemstones, coins, or other precious items are often used, and they are typically set into precious metals. Platinum alloys range from 900 (90% pure) to 950 (95% pure). The silver used in jewellery is usually sterling silver, or 92.5% fine silver. In costume jewellery, stainless steel findings are sometimes used.

            Other commonly used materials include glass, such as fused-glass or enamel; wood, often carved or turned; shells and other natural animal substances such as bone and ivory; natural clay; polymer clay; Hemp and other twines have been used as well to create jewellery that has more of a natural feel. However, any inclusion of lead or lead solder will give a British Assay office (the body which gives U.K. jewellery its stamp of approval, the Hallmark) the right to destroy the piece, however, it is very rare for the assay office to do so.</p>
